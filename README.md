## Overview

This repository contains a Streamlit-based interface that estimates diabetes risk from clinical parameters.
The application loads a trained Logistic Regression model and generates probability-based predictions in real time.

The objective of this project is to showcase practical machine learning deployment within a healthcare analytics context.
